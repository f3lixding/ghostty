# Agent Development Guide

A file for [guiding coding agents](https://agents.md/).

## Commands

- **Build:** `zig build`
- **Test (Zig):** `zig build test`
- **Test filter (Zig)**: `zig build test -Dtest-filter=<test name>`
- **Formatting (Zig)**: `zig fmt .`
- **Formatting (other)**: `prettier -w .`

## Directory Structure

- Shared Zig core: `src/`
- C API: `include`
- macOS app: `macos/`
- GTK (Linux and FreeBSD) app: `src/apprt/gtk`

## libghostty-vt

- Build: `zig build lib-vt`
- Build Wasm Module: `zig build lib-vt -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding`
- Test: `zig build test-lib-vt`
- Test filter: `zig build test-lib-vt -Dtest-filter=<test name>`
- When working on libghostty-vt, do not build the full app.
- For C only changes, don't run the Zig tests. Build all the examples.

## macOS App

- Do not use `xcodebuild`
- Use `zig build` to build the macOS app and any shared Zig code
- Use `zig build run` to build and run the macOS app
- Run Xcode tests using `zig build test`

# Explanation Guide
This is for when you are asked a question about the codebase

Format your answer assuming the user does not have any prior knowledge
associated with the domain and include necessary information for your answer to
make sense

If you are providing examples, DO NOT use pseudocode and reference actual code
snippet in the codebase. Make sure to include where this snippet is from with
the format of [filename, line number]
